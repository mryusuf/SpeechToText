# SpeechToText

A simple app to detect your speech with Apple Speech Framework and your general voice filler. This app uses the CMU Pocketsphinx library, the CMU Flite library, selections from the CMU CMUCMLTK library (http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net), and Politepixâ€™s OpenEars (http://www.politepix.com/openears).
